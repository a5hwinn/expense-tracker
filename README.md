This is a menu-driven expense tracker made by using python.

It contains functions for adding the number of expenses made, erasing the past expenses stored, viewing the overll expense history and to calculate the overall expenditures made.
By making this program it will be easier to keep track of the money we spend on a daily basis and also help keep track of the budget we have in hand.
